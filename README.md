We have been asked to help Budweiser identify which states should host events for breweries. The two provided datasets contain lists of 2410 US craft beers across 558 US breweries consisting of the style of beer, ABV (Alcohol by Volume), IBU (International Bitterness Units), and the brewery's city and state. An analysis was done on this data in order to provide recommendations to the CEO and CFO of Budweiser.
